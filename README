I use dwm as my window manager (via startx) on Gentoo Linux.

First see: https://dwm.suckless.org

Patches applied:
1. alpha 
2. three column layout extended (see below)
3. cyclelayouts
4. default transparency
5. fullgaps

Customization: noapps

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Concerning the three column layout: 
https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/three-column/
...i changed the tcl.c file enough, so as to rename it to adatcl.c. 
You can still find the original file inside the refer folder. 
The reason for change was to extend the fullgaps patch to apply to
the three column layout as well.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Inside the refer folder there are files for simple reference, since
they are related to dwm:
1. compton.conf - My configuration file for Compton compositor
2. .xinitrc - For startx
3. tcl.c - see above

What follows is the Original README from Suckless/dwm.

dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.
